# z_errors_model

Scripts that compute the correlation function model of the auto- and cross-correlation of the Lyman-alpha forest with quasars.
This work was produced for Youles et al. (in prep). 

Run it with

`python bin/z_errors_model.py --output mymodel.pkl` 

It takes about less than 5 min with the default options. 

You can plot it in a terminal with

`python bin/z_errors_model.py --plot mymodel.pkl`
